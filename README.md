# Food-Adulteration-Dataset

The dataset contains spectral data collected using Advanced ATR-MIR Spectroscopy for pure groundnut oil and various levels of adulteration with palm oil. The data was collected at 128 wavelengths, and there are a total of 160 data samples, with 40 samples for the pure class and 40 samples for each of the 50%, 25%, and 6.25% adulterated classes.

The dataset can be used for classification tasks to detect the presence of palm oil adulteration in groundnut oil. It can be useful for researchers and data scientists working in the food industry, specifically in quality control and product authentication. The dataset may also be used to develop machine learning models for detecting adulteration in other edible oils using similar spectroscopic methods.

The data was collected using state-of-the-art spectroscopic techniques, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.
